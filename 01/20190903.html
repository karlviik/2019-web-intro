<p style="font-size:100px"><b>"All Star"</b></p>

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
<br>I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
<br>She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
<br>In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
<br>
<br>Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
<br>Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
<br>Didn't make sense not to live for fun
<br>Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
<br>
<br>So much to do, so much to see
<br>So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
<br>You'll never know if you don't go
<br>You'll never shine if you don't glow
<br>
<br>Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
<br>Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
<br>And all that glitters is gold
<br>Only shooting stars break the mold
<br>
<br>It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
<br>You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
<br>But the meteor men beg to differ
<br>Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
<br>
<br>The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
<br>The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
<br>My world's on fire. How about yours?
<br>That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
<br>
<br>Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
<br>Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
<br>And all that glitters is gold
<br>Only shooting stars break the mold
<br>
<br>Go for the moon
<br>Go for the moon
<br>Go for the moon
<br>Go for the moon
<br>
<br>Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
<br>Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
<br>And all that glitters is gold
<br>Only shooting stars
<br>
<br>Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
<br>I need to get myself away from this place
<br>I said yep, what a concept
<br>I could use a little fuel myself
<br>And we could all use a little change
<br>
<br>Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
<br>Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
<br>Didn't make sense not to live for fun
<br>Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
<br>
<br>So much to do, so much to see
<br>So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
<br>You'll never know if you don't go
<br>You'll never shine if you don't glow
<br>
<br>Hey, now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
<br>Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
<br>And all that glitters is gold
<br>Only shooting stars break the mold
<br>
<br>And all that glitters is gold
<br>Only shooting stars break the mold
